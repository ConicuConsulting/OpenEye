### **Introduction**
The complexity of AI systems has led to incredible advancements in data analysis and predictive modeling, yet many models face inefficiencies when tasked with handling cross-domain relationships or reasoning across multiple fields like healthcare, law, or finance. This thesis introduces **Relational Neural Networks (RNNs)**—an evolution in neural networks that embeds relational context within data, improving AI model efficiency and enhancing multi-domain insights.

This framework is inspired by my personal journey of learning through AI systems such as **ChatGPT** and developing scalable cloud architectures across enterprise environments. Through these experiences, I’ve learned to combine the power of neural networks with relational networks to create **modular, attribute-based systems** that map complex relationships efficiently.

### **Identifying the Gaps in Current AI Models**
Traditional neural networks process data but struggle to efficiently infer relationships between datasets across multiple fields without large computational requirements. While effective at tasks such as pattern recognition and image analysis, these models lack the ability to handle data with **predefined relationships** between entities.

Relational Neural Networks (RNNs) address this by structuring data into **modular components**, where relationships are established dynamically, not inferred through computation each time. This minimizes computational overhead, allowing AI to focus on solving higher-order problems with efficiency and precision.

---

### **The Concept: Modular Relational Neural Networks**
RNNs are built on a modular framework where each **document or dataset** is ingested as a **self-contained module**. Each module contains:
- **Nodes**: Representing entities such as documents, sections, or data points.
- **Attributes**: Defining the relationships or characteristics of these nodes (e.g., legal, financial, medical, etc.).
- **Policies**: Governing how relationships between nodes are formed and processed.
- **Strings**: Efficient pathways for querying and referencing related nodes.

For example, a legal document ingested into the system would have **clauses**, **sections**, and **subsections** as nodes, each linked through **relationships** based on the **attributes** of the law. The framework allows for dynamic querying between different documents, legal codes, or frameworks. This modular approach forms the backbone of an efficient, scalable AI model capable of understanding cross-domain interactions.

---

### **Building Relationships Across Domains**
Once a dataset is ingested as a module, the RNN enables **cross-domain queries**. Here, the AI can draw relationships between different datasets—allowing for insights such as how healthcare regulations affect tax laws, or how legal precedents influence financial compliance policies.

Each relationship between data points is mapped in the system and can be queried using an **API**, leveraging pre-defined **strings**. These strings provide a highly efficient way for the AI to pull relevant data in real-time. For example, a query into healthcare regulations could automatically reference the specific tax codes or legal restrictions involved in compliance.

---

### **Attribute-Based Modular Design**
RNNs are driven by **attributes**—specific tags or values that provide context to nodes. In a legal framework, an attribute might define whether a law is **federal** or **state-level**, while in healthcare, an attribute could indicate whether the regulation is **clinical** or **administrative**. These attributes streamline the AI’s ability to query and return contextual data efficiently.

---

### **String-Based Querying: Efficient Data Access**
One of the key innovations in RNNs is the introduction of **string-based querying**, which allows AI systems to pull related information in real-time. This system connects specific subsections of documents (e.g., tax clauses or legal regulations) by referencing pre-defined strings, drastically improving response times and making multi-disciplinary data querying seamless.

In practice, this means that rather than processing all data from scratch, the AI uses **relational strings** to pull related information from different modules, speeding up **decision-making** and **contextual understanding**.

---

### **Improving Model Efficiency and Cognitive Thinking**
By embedding these relationships directly within the data structure, the AI system is able to mimic **cognitive thinking** more closely. Instead of repeatedly processing relationships from scratch, RNNs create **predefined pathways** between data, reducing the need for computational power while increasing model accuracy and speed.

This relational and modular approach also mirrors the way we approach complex systems thinking in everyday life, allowing for more **natural decision-making processes** and more **intuitive AI models**.

---

### **Practical Use Case: The OpenEye Project**
A practical application of this methodology can be seen in the **OpenEye Project**, where RNNs are used to map legal and governmental frameworks to improve transparency. By creating relationships between policies, regulations, and legal precedents, the system allows for real-time cross-querying of legal data to provide insights into how different laws intersect.

Imagine querying the system for the legal implications of merging a healthcare company with a financial firm. OpenEye would dynamically reference **anti-monopoly laws**, **tax regulations**, and **healthcare policy**, all of which are pre-mapped through relational attributes. This allows decision-makers to get an accurate, real-time overview of the legal landscape without needing to parse complex documents themselves.

### **Creating a New Standard: RNNs for Scalable AI Systems**
By merging **Neural Networks** with **Relational Networks**, RNNs provide a new standard for scalable AI models. They improve model efficiency by allowing the AI to focus on decision-making, reducing computational load, and enhancing the ability to process cross-domain relationships seamlessly.

As this methodology scales, it can be applied to various industries—healthcare, law, finance, and more—allowing professionals to leverage AI for faster, more informed decisions.

---

### **Conclusion**
Relational Neural Networks represent a significant advancement in AI model design by allowing for the creation of modular, attribute-driven data structures that can be queried across multiple domains. This method reduces computational overhead, increases model efficiency, and improves the scalability of AI applications. As AI systems evolve, the implementation of RNNs has the potential to unlock new possibilities in **cross-disciplinary insights**, **scalable AI frameworks**, and **real-world decision-making**.

### **Call to Action**
This framework is just the beginning. By sharing these concepts through the OpenEye project and other mediums, I hope to collaborate with others in the AI space to further develop this methodology. I invite academics, professionals, and developers to explore the possibilities of **Relational Neural Networks** and how they can drive innovation across multiple sectors.
