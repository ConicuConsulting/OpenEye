# OpenEye: Global Government Transparency Tool

## Introduction

**OpenEye** is an open-source platform designed to make government policies, laws, and regulations accessible and understandable for everyone. By providing unbiased, raw data in a clear and visual format, OpenEye empowers citizens to explore how their governments function, helping them make informed decisions and engage more effectively in the democratic process.

Leveraging cutting-edge technologies, including cloud services on **Microsoft Azure**, **Neo4j** for graph databases, and the **OpenAI API**, OpenEye processes complex governmental data and presents it in an intuitive and user-friendly way. **Slapp**, a partner in this project, provides the enterprise cloud infrastructure and hosting services to ensure scalability and reliability.

## Why OpenEye Matters

Government policies are often buried in legal language, making them difficult to understand. **OpenEye** aims to demystify this information by offering:

- **Direct Access**: Offering unfiltered access to raw government documents, laws, and policies.
- **AI-Powered Insights**: Using AI to simplify complex information for easier understanding.
- **Transparency**: Promoting open governance by making data readily available to citizens globally.
- **Global Scale**: Starting with U.S. data but designed to scale internationally, allowing contributors to add data from any region.
- **Policy Impacts**: Visualizing how policies affect international relations, trade, and governance structures worldwide.

## Key Features

- **Unbiased Data Access**: Explore government data without editorializing or bias.
- **AI-Driven Summaries**: The **OpenAI API** generates concise summaries of lengthy and complex documents.
- **Interactive Visualizations**: Visualize the relationships between laws through graphs and dynamic maps.
- **Global Collaboration**: Built for contributions from citizens worldwide to manage their region's data.
- **Advanced Search**: Quickly find laws, policies, and related data through powerful search features.
- **Global Policy Mapping**: Understand foreign policies and how they affect global trade, diplomacy, and governance.

## Recent Technical Enhancements

### Neo4j Graph Database Integration

**OpenEye** now uses **Neo4j** to store legal documents and their relationships in a graph database, allowing users to explore connections between sections of laws and policies. Each legal section is ingested as a node, and relationships (references, dependencies, etc.) are established between sections for deeper insights into how laws interact.

### CUDA Acceleration for Relationship Mapping

To handle the large datasets involved in OpenEye, **CUDA** is now integrated to accelerate the relationship-building process between nodes. This allows for faster computation of connections and the creation of a detailed map of the legal framework, making it possible to analyze relationships like dependencies or cross-references in real-time.

By treating sections of legal text like Python functions (with parameters and dependencies), we model these connections within the graph database. This structure enables a deeper understanding of legal texts by visualizing the flow and interactions between different laws.

### Modular Script Updates

To streamline the processing and ingestion of data into Neo4j, we've split the previous monolithic script into modular components:

1. **extract_xml_from_zip.py**: Extracts XML files from the downloaded ZIP archives.
2. **convert_to_json.py**: Converts the extracted XML files into a JSON-like format for further processing.
3. **import_to_neo4j.py**: Imports JSON data into the Neo4j database, creating nodes for each section and establishing relationships.
4. **parse_and_link_references.py**: Parses references between sections and links them within Neo4j to form a comprehensive legal framework.

This modularity makes it easier to manage, debug, and scale the platform as it grows.

## How OpenEye Utilizes the OpenAI API

The **OpenAI API** is integral to making OpenEye a powerful tool for transparency and accessibility:

1. **Summarizing Legal Documents**:
   - **AI Summaries**: Automatically generate natural-language summaries of complex legal documents.
   - **Time-Saving**: Users can quickly understand the core points without reading through entire documents.
   
2. **Analyzing Policy Impact**:
   - **Cross-Legislation Insights**: Identifies connections between laws, highlighting how one policy might affect others.
   - **Predictive Analytics**: Provides insight into the possible outcomes of policy changes.
   
3. **Interactive Q&A**:
   - **Conversational AI**: Users can ask questions in natural language about specific laws or policies.
   - **Contextual Answers**: AI provides accurate responses based on the law's data.

4. **Multilingual Translation**:
   - **Global Accessibility**: The platform supports translations via OpenAI to make documents understandable across languages.
