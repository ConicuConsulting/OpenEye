OpenEye: Global Government Transparency Tool

Introduction

OpenEye is an open-source platform designed to make government policies and laws accessible and understandable to everyone. By providing unbiased, raw data in a clear and visual format, the tool helps citizens explore how their governments function and empowers them to make informed decisions.

The project leverages cutting-edge technology, including Slapp’s cloud architecture on Azure and the OpenAI API, to process complex governmental data and present it in a way that’s easy to navigate.

Why This Matters

Government policies are often hidden behind complex legal frameworks that can be difficult for everyday citizens to understand. OpenEye aims to change that by providing direct access to legal documents and policies in a clear, unbiased way, supported by AI-driven insights.

Key Features

	•	Unbiased Data: Explore raw government policies and legislation without political bias.
	•	OpenAI-Powered Summarizations: We use the OpenAI API to summarize lengthy and complex documents, making them more digestible for the average user.
	•	Interactive Visualizations: Navigate policies and laws through dynamic maps and network graphs that show the relationships between different pieces of legislation.
	•	Global Expansion: OpenEye starts with U.S. data but is built to scale globally, allowing contributors from different countries to add data for their regions.

How We Use the OpenAI API

OpenEye integrates the OpenAI API to enhance the functionality of the platform. Here’s how it’s used:

	•	Summarizing Legal Documents: Governmental policies and laws can be lengthy and difficult to interpret. OpenAI’s GPT model helps summarize complex sections of legal text, providing users with concise, plain-language summaries.
	•	Policy Impact Analysis: By analyzing connections between different pieces of legislation, the OpenAI API helps identify how changes in one policy might affect others, offering insights into the broader implications of new laws.
	•	Question & Answer Functionality: Using OpenAI’s language models, OpenEye allows users to ask natural language questions about specific laws or policies, and receive clear, accurate responses based on the data.

The OpenAI API enables us to transform large volumes of complex governmental data into something that can be easily understood by the public. This makes the platform not only a source of information but also an intelligent assistant that helps users navigate the intricacies of governance.

Technical Overview

OpenEye is built using Slapp’s cloud architecture on Microsoft Azure, with the following core components:

	•	Frontend: Built using React.js, hosted on Azure Web Apps, providing a responsive and scalable user interface.
	•	Backend: Powered by Azure Functions for serverless, scalable operations, including data processing and API requests.
	•	Data Storage:
	•	Azure SQL Database for structured government policy and legislation data.
	•	Azure Blob Storage for unstructured data such as PDFs, documents, and multimedia.
	•	APIs: RESTful APIs expose the platform’s data and insights to the frontend, ensuring smooth interaction between users and the backend systems.

We use OpenAI’s language models to process complex text data and offer insights that would otherwise take users hours of reading and interpretation.

How to Get Involved

We’re actively seeking contributors to help expand and improve OpenEye:

	•	Developers: Help build new features, improve performance, or enhance security.
	•	Data Experts: Contribute governmental data from your country or region.
	•	OpenAI Enthusiasts: Help us improve the use of OpenAI’s models by fine-tuning the implementation for specific use cases in governance and policy.
