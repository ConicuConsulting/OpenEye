# OpenEye - Global Government Transparency Tool

Introduction

Welcome to the Global Government Transparency Tool, a project designed to break down barriers to understanding how governments around the world operate. By giving citizens access to structured, unbiased information, we aim to make governance transparent, empowering people to ask the right questions and make informed decisions.

Transparency is key to building a more democratic and informed society. Through this project, we provide access to data on tax laws, legislative frameworks, and policies in an accessible and open-source format.

The project is supported by Slapp, a trusted cloud partner providing the architecture needed to host, scale, and maintain the platform. By leveraging Microsoft Azure technologies, we ensure that the platform remains robust, secure, and performant, offering an environment that will allow this initiative to grow globally.

Slapp, specializes in providing cloud solutions that are scalable, secure, and built with cutting-edge technologies like Azure Web Apps and Azure Functions.

Why Does This Matter?

We live in a world where political and governmental decisions deeply affect us, but for many, the inner workings of governments are opaque. This project changes that by:

	•	Providing Clear Information: Direct access to laws and policies in an understandable format.
	•	Enabling Accountability: Allowing citizens to hold their governments responsible for their actions.
	•	Fostering Global Collaboration: Anyone can contribute data and insights to this platform, enabling broader global transparency.

Project Vision

We envision a world where transparency and understanding are the norms in governance. This platform will make governmental policies and actions available to everyone, no matter where they are or how much they know about politics. By democratizing access to this information, we enable people to:

	•	Make Better Decisions: With the right knowledge, people can vote more intelligently, advocate for themselves, and engage in meaningful political discourse.
	•	Ask the Right Questions: When citizens have access to clear and accurate information, they can hold their governments accountable.
	•	Contribute Globally: We’re building a community where people around the world can contribute and verify data to ensure it stays accurate and up-to-date.

High-Level Overview

Key Features

	•	Global Data Access: Explore government policies from countries all over the world, with the platform starting in the U.S. and expanding globally.
	•	Interactive Visualizations: Use maps and graphs to visually explore complex governmental structures and policies.
	•	Collaboration-Driven: We’re creating a community where anyone can contribute government data, ensuring broad coverage and accuracy.
	•	Trusted Architecture: Built on Slapp’s cloud platform, using Azure Web Apps, Azure Functions, and Azure SQL, providing a highly reliable and scalable system.
	•	Open Source with Integrity: We’re sharing all the code to foster collaboration, but with a license to ensure that no one misuses the tool to spread misinformation.

Progressive Technical Breakdown

High-Level Architecture

This project uses Slapp’s cloud architecture on Microsoft Azure, ensuring that the platform is scalable, secure, and available globally. The platform is divided into several core components:

	•	Frontend: Built with React.js, hosted on Azure Web Apps for a seamless user experience.
	•	Backend: Powered by Azure Functions, which handle data processing and API requests in a scalable, serverless environment.
	•	Data Storage:
	•	Azure SQL Database: For structured data storage of government policies and legislation.
	•	Azure Blob Storage: For unstructured data, such as legal documents, PDFs, and multimedia.
	•	APIs: RESTful APIs are used to serve data and manage user interactions.
	•	Data Ingestion: Automated data ingestion pipelines using Azure Functions to regularly fetch and update the data from governmental websites and validated sources.

Technical Details

1. Frontend (React.js)

	•	Hosted on Azure Web Apps: This ensures that the frontend is scalable and always available.
	•	Responsive UI: The platform is built to be responsive, ensuring users can access it on all devices.
	•	Visualizations: Utilizing D3.js and Mapbox GL JS, the frontend enables users to explore the interconnectedness of laws, tax policies, and governmental structures.

2. Backend (Azure Functions)

	•	Serverless Architecture: Built on Azure Functions, the backend is highly scalable and handles fluctuating traffic efficiently.
	•	APIs: The backend exposes RESTful APIs for the frontend to query data and perform operations.
	•	Data Processing: Functions are used to ingest data from government websites, process it, and store it in the database or blob storage.
	•	Security: API endpoints are secured using Azure Active Directory B2C, ensuring secure access and authentication.

3. Data Storage

	•	Azure SQL Database: The relational database is used to store structured data about tax policies, legislation, and their relationships.
	•	Azure Blob Storage: Legal documents and unstructured data are stored here, allowing for efficient access and scaling.
	•	Caching: We implement caching mechanisms to speed up data retrieval and improve the user experience.

4. Data Ingestion Pipelines

	•	Automated Data Updates: Scheduled Azure Functions pull data from validated governmental sources (primarily .gov domains) to ensure that the database is up-to-date.
	•	OCR and Parsing: For scanned documents, Tesseract OCR is used to extract text, which is then processed and stored.
	•	Data Validation: Before storing the data, it’s validated against known sources to prevent misinformation or errors.

Detailed Infrastructure Overview

1. Azure Web Apps

	•	Scalable Frontend Hosting: The platform leverages Azure Web Apps for easy deployment and scaling.
	•	Continuous Deployment: Integrated with GitHub Actions for CI/CD pipelines, enabling seamless updates.

2. Azure Functions

	•	Consumption Plan: The serverless model allows the platform to scale automatically based on traffic.
	•	Bindings: Input/output bindings allow the functions to interact with the Azure SQL Database, Blob Storage, and other services effortlessly.
	•	Event-Driven Architecture: Azure Functions are triggered by events such as data updates, user interactions, or scheduled jobs.

3. Azure SQL Database

	•	Elastic Pools: Used for dynamic scaling of the database, allowing us to adjust resources based on demand.
	•	Relational Data Modeling: We use a normalized database schema to map out government policies, laws, and relationships effectively.

4. Azure Blob Storage

	•	Storage Tiers: We utilize the Hot and Cool access tiers based on the frequency of access to documents.
	•	Content Delivery Network (CDN): Integrated with Azure CDN to ensure that documents are served quickly worldwide.
