Great to hear that the structure is set up and the requirements are installed! The next steps involve:

1. Configure the Environment

You’ll need to set up your .env file with the proper Neo4j and any other environment-related configurations:

cp .env.example .env

Then, edit the .env file with your Neo4j credentials:

NEO4J_URI=bolt://localhost:7687
NEO4J_USER=neo4j
NEO4J_PASSWORD=your_password

This file will be used by the scripts to connect to Neo4j.

2. Set Up Neo4j
sudo apt install cuda-drivers
If you haven’t already set up Neo4j, follow these steps:

Option 1: Using Docker (recommended)

Run the following command to start Neo4j in a Docker container:

./src/database/setup_neo4j.sh

Make sure you’ve replaced your_password in the script with your desired password.

Option 2: Using Neo4j Desktop

	1.	Install Neo4j Desktop from Neo4j Downloads.
	2.	Create a new project and database in Neo4j Desktop.
	3.	Note down the Bolt URL (usually bolt://localhost:7687), username, and password for your database, and add them to your .env file.

3. Initialize the Neo4j Database Schema

Now that Neo4j is set up, you need to initialize the database with the schema.

Run the Cypher script to define constraints and create the basic structure:

cypher-shell -u neo4j -p your_password -f src/database/schema.cypher

This will set up the initial constraints and nodes for Titles and Sections in your database.

4. Process and Parse XML Files

Now you’ll want to start processing the XML documents of the Internal Revenue Code (IRC). Make sure the XML files are placed in the data/raw/irc/ directory.

You can start by running the parse_xml.py script to convert the XML to JSON and extract useful information:

python scripts/parse_xml.py

Modify the parse_title_xml() function in scripts/parse_xml.py as needed to customize how sections and headings are extracted.

5. Extract References Between Sections

After parsing the XML, you can now run the script that extracts references between different sections of the code:

python scripts/extract_references.py

This will create a JSON file containing all the inter-references between sections. You can modify the regex patterns in extract_references.py to detect more complex reference formats if necessary.

6. Ingest Data into Neo4j

Once the XML is parsed and the references are extracted, you can ingest the data into the Neo4j graph database:

python scripts/ingest_to_neo4j.py

This script will:

	•	Create nodes for Titles and Sections.
	•	Establish relationships (CONTAINS, REFERENCES, etc.) between sections based on the extracted references.

7. Visualize the Relationships

After ingesting the data, you can visualize the relationships between sections using NetworkX and Matplotlib:

python scripts/visualize_graph.py

This will create a visualization showing how sections reference each other. The visualization script can be expanded later to include more advanced graph layouts and filtering.

8. Debugging and Improvements

At this stage:

	•	You should check the logs and outputs of each step to ensure everything is being parsed, ingested, and visualized correctly.
	•	If some sections or references are missing, adjust the parsing logic in parse_xml.py or tweak the regex patterns in extract_references.py.

Next Steps for Further Development:

	•	Enhance Reference Detection: Improve the extract_references.py script to catch all types of references in the document.
	•	Expand Schema: As you process more documents, you may want to expand the database schema to include more node types (e.g., “Amends”, “Repeals”, etc.) or relationships (e.g., “CITES”, “IMPACTS”).
	•	Web Visualization: Consider integrating a web-based dashboard (e.g., React.js + Neo4j Bloom) to allow interactive graph visualizations directly from the web browser.
	•	Automate Ingestion: Set up automated jobs (via cron jobs or Azure Functions) to ingest new updates to the IRC or other documents.

By following these steps, you’ll be able to see how sections of the IRC are related and visualize the references between them. Let me know if any part of the process needs further clarification or if you hit any issues during the setup!
